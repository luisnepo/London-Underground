# London-Underground 

Coursework on advanced algorithms required on my 2nd year at Bsc Computer  science.

# Coursework Requirements:

This coursework required the users to be able to interact with a program to enter their starting station as well as their desired final station and have the program calculate the total time needed for the trip and to show the user all the stops in between.

This was done by utlizing dijkstra algorithm to scan a database and to find the shortes possible way while also giving accurate times as well as adding the average time 
the train would stop in a station(around 2 minutes).
